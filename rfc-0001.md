# Holdings Rebalance

## Abstract

The user is enabled to manage its current holdings, seeing the amount of
coin/tokens holded per wallets, its countervalue in USD (or any other currency)
and the percentage of assets allocated per wallet.

## Motivation

Holding a coin or a token is probably one of the most used approaches to
long-term betting that asset, mainly because the low effort it requires to be
carried out. However, holding without a strategy may hurt at some point: a good
wallet has long-term objectives, such us the decomposition of the wallet in
slices where each slice represent the percent of our wallet allocated to an
asset. In the fast-evolving blockchain world is really easy to lose control of
our wallet.

Thus, being able to always know the amount of wallet allocated on a strategy is
a crucial feature that every holder should take into account.

## Specification

First of all, some definitions

- An **asset** is something valuable wrt a base currency, such as a
  currency/coin like _USD_ or _Bitcoin_, a token, an NFT, a future or a
  perpetual.

- A **wallet** represents a pair `(balance, asset)` with the semantic "I have
  `balance` of `asset`".

- A **pocket** is a collection of wallets. Optionally, each wallet in a pocket
  can be associated with a percentage of (countervalue) allocation that the
  wallet should follow. A user may have only one pocket, with many wallets
  inside, or multiple pockets.

### Example

Given a wallet `w`, we define `asset(w)` the function that returns the assets
that balance is expressed with, while `balance(w)` returns the balance of the
wallet `w`. Given an asset `x`, we define `countervalue(x)` as the fuction that
returns the countervalue of the asset `x` in a certain base currency. We also
extend this function to return the countervalue of a wallet `w` such that
`countervalue(W) = currency(W) * balance(W)`.

> In our example, the user can manage the assets `a` with `countervalue(a) = 1`
> and `b` with `countervalue(b) = 10`. The user defines two wallets belonging to
> the same pocket: `w1` with `balance(w1) = 100` resulting in
> `countervalue(w1) = 100`, and `w2` with `balance(w2) = 50` resulting in
> `countervalue(w2) = 500`.

> The user assign 25% of allocation to `w1` (`target(w1) = 25`), while 75% to
> `w2` (`target(w2) = 75`).

At this point, given `Ws` the set of wallets in the pocket (in our case
`Ws = {w1, w2}`) the system is able to compute the current allocation for each
wallet, i.e. `allocation(w) = countervalue(w) / (sum_i Wi) * 100`.

> Thus, `allocation(w1) = 16.6`, `allocation(w2) = 83.3`.

The difference of allocation is simply computed as `delta(w) = target(w) - allocation(w)`.

The number of assets to buy or to sell to rebalance each wallet `w` is computed
`delta(w) * (sum_i Wi) / 100`.

> In our example, `delta(w1) = 8.3%` while `delta(w2) = -8.3%`, thus in order to
> balance the pocket we should **buy** some `a` such that their countervalue is
> the `8.3%` of the total (_~ 49 a_), while we should sell some `b` such that
> their countervalue is `8.3%` of the total (~ 4.9 b).
