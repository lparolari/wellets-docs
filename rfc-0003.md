# Farm Monitoring

## Abstract

Add farms to the system and show divergence loss.

## Motivation

Farms are a simple way to get a revenue on tokens you would like to hold.
However, they can be quite tricky to manage, mainly because divergence loss and
variable APR/APY.

## Specification

For a better comprehension of concepts like divergence loss, we redirect you to
the following articles:

- https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/V2/concepts/advanced-topics/understanding-returns;
- https://pintail.medium.com/uniswap-a-good-deal-for-liquidity-providers-104c0b6816f2.

We define `F = (t_1, t_2, ..., t_n)` a farm where each `t_i` is a token
associated with its price `p_i`, and `W = (w_1, w_2, ..., w_n)` the weight of
each token in the farm. Please note that `sum_i W_i = 1`.

A user should be able to create a farm and add liquidity to it, by fixing tokens
price. For example Alice creates the farm "A-B 50%" where `A` and `B` are tokens
and `w_1 = 0.5`, `w_2 = 0.5`. Alice adds liquidity to the farm by providing
`10 A` and `100 B`, because `A = 10 $`, `B = 1 $`, thus `1 A = 10 B`,
`1 B = 1/10 A`. Note that Alice provide the same countervalue of tokens for `A`
and `B`.

We define `v_i` the number of tokens provided for each side of the pool. In our
example, `v_1 = 10` and `v_2 = 100`. We define `K = prod_i v_i` the product of
tokens in pool which must remain the same.

Given a new countervalue for tokens `A` and `B`, namely `p_1 = 20`, `p_2 = 1`,
we compute divergence loss, i.e. the difference countervalue between simply
holding tokens and having them in the farm.

According to Uniswap's constant product formula, we compute
`v'_1 = sqrt(K * p_2 / p_1)` and `v'_2 = sqrt(K * p_1 / p_2)`, where `v'_i` is
the new amount of tokens in pool. Please note that `prod_i v'_i = K`.
In our example `v'_1 = sqrt(1000 * 1 / 20) = 7.07` while
`v'_2 = sqrt(1000 * 20 / 1) = 141.42`.

Simply holding tokens leads to `H = sum_i t_i * p_i`, which in our case means
`H = 10 * 20 + 100 * 1 = 300`.

Having them in the farm instead leads to a countervalue of
`Y = v'_1 * p_1 + v'_2 * p_2 = 282.84`. Thus, the divergence loss
`L = (H - Y) / H * 100 = (300 - 282.84) / 300 * 100 = 5.72 %`.

### Features

- Add a two-pool 50/50 farm

- Move funds from wallets/pocket to farm and back

- Show divergence loss given new tokens countervalue

- Show divergence loss with current tokens countervalue
