# Holdings Snapshots

## Abstract

A snapshot system allows to keep track of wallet balances and countervalues over
time.

## Motivation

A good strategy requires to fix issues encountered during time, thus, requires
to monitor the holdings performance. For this reason, we need a snapshot system
which freeze the value of wallets along with their countervalue. Such data will
help analyze performance.

## Specification

Given a wallet as the pair `(balance, asset)`, we need to periodically freeze
the wallet balance and the asset countervalue. Such history of values allows to
represent wallet balance and countervalue over time.

The system may show plot the wallet balance and countervalue in function of
time.

Please note that the system has to define the maximum sampling rate used to
snapshot wallets, i.e., time resolution. (For example, 1 day).

### Feature

- Plot the balance in function of time.

- Plot the wallet countervalue in function of time.

- Browse wallet balance and countervalue history.

- Choose the default time resolution (greater or equal the system defined time resolution).

- Select a time window for analyzing wallet performance.
